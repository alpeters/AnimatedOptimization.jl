# AnimatedOptimization.jl

Some optimization algorithms (for any function) with animations for
functions from R² → R.

These are meant for teaching. They have not been extenisvely tested
and are likely not well-suited for other uses. 

For usage see [this document](optimization.html) or [a notebook version](optimization.ipynb).
