    "The goal of this notebook is to give you some familiarity with numeric\n",
    "optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric optimization is important because many (most) models cannot be\n",
    "fully solved analytically. Numeric results can be used to complement\n",
    "analytic ones. Numeric optimization plays a huge role in econometrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these notes, we will focus on minimization problems following the\n",
    "convention in mathematics, engineering, and most numerical\n",
    "libraries. It is easy to convert between minimization and\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\min_x f(x)\n",

    "\n",
    "with $f:\\R^n \\to \\R$. Heuristic search algorithms consist of \n",

    "1. Evaluate $f$ at a collection of points \n",
    "2. Generate a new candidate point, $x^{new}$. Replace a point\n",
    "   in the current collection with $x^{new}$ if $f(x^{new})$ is small enough. \n",
    "3. Stop when function value stops decreasing and/or collection of\n",
    "   points become too close together. \n",
    "   \n",
    "There are many variants of such algorithms with different ways of\n",
    "generating new points, deciding whether to accept the new point, and\n",
    "deciding when to stop.  Here is a simple implementation and animation\n",
    "of the above idea. In the code below, new points are drawn randomly\n",
    "from a normal distribution, and new points are accepted whenever\n",
