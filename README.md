# AnimatedOptimization

Some optimization algorithms with animations for functions from R² → R.

These are meant for teaching. They have not been extenisvely tested
and are likely not well-suited for other uses. 

For usage see [these notes.](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/pschrimpf/526/julia/optimization.html)
